SoftQuake 2023

This takes has been taken almost verbatim from QuakeSpasm-Music.txt
Version 0.94.2

When writing the CD audio emulation, I used their codebase as a reference.
As a result, the implementation and functionality is similar, but not exact.

SoftQuake (and QuakeSpasm) supports ogg, mp3 and wav external music files to be played
instead of cd music. What you should do is simple:

1. Use your favorite cd-ripper application and rip your quake cdrom
   audio tracks, convert them to ogg or mp3 so they occupy less space,
   like track02.ogg, track03.ogg, etc.

   Note #1: There is no such thing as track01:  the first tracks of
            original Quake and the mission pack cdroms are always data
            tracks.

   Note #2: Since the Quake cdrom audio tracks are pre-emphasized, you
            should de-emphasize them during or after ripping to make
            them sound right. (thanks to Sander van Dijk for this note)

2. Go into your quake installation directory and create a new directory
   id1/music (for windows users id1\music).

3. If you have the Scourge of Armagon mission pack, then create another
   directory hipnotic/music .  If you have the Dissolution of Eternity
   then create another directory rogue/music .

4. Take the ripped music files from step1, place them under id1/music.
   If you have the mission packs, repeat step1 for the mission packs,
   too, and place the ripped music files under hipnotic/music for the
   first mission pack or under rogue/music for the second mission pack.

5. All are ready to go: When a level starts, the engine will first try
   playing the necessary cdaudio track and if it doesn't find the cdrom
   it will use the ripped music files instead.
