========================
*** 1.1.0
*** 2023-09-20
========================
* Add PNG support for screenshots. Set ENABLE_PNG = 1 in `4_options.mk` or `meson.build` to enable.
* Fix file handle leak in cd_sdl.c.
* Add `host_maxfps` cvar. Defaults to 72 as in the original game. Set to lower values to emulate lower framerates.
  Values above 72 may cause physics bugs.
* Increase cd audio buffer size from 512 to 1024 bytes.
* cd audio is no longer audible if the cvar `bgmvolume` is 0 when the game is launched.
* Provide a better error message when using `sw_backend`.
  Specifying an invalid video backend with `sw_backend` will now notify the player immediately, instead of on the next restart.
  SDL2 will be used as a fallback, as before, except that now it will set the cvar to "sdl". Previously it did not.
  `sw_backend` only affects the software renderer. GLQuake remains unaffected, but can still access this variable.
* Add precompiled header to Makefile build. This speeds up the Windows build by almost 2x.
  If you're compiling the game yourself, you may want to delete the header manually after building,
  since it can take up quite a bit of disk space. In this build, the file is `quakedef.h.gch`
  Otherwise, the file is removed as part of the clean target.
* Fix `clean` target for Makefile. Now all targets are cleaned properly.
* Implement D_BeginDirectRect in the software renderer.
  This draws the loading icon in the top-right corner, just like in the DOS version.

========================
*** 1.0.0
*** 2023-09-01
========================
* Initial release
* Binary releases are available in the release section of the repository
  Players can use two versions of the game:
  
  softquake-sdl
  glquake-sdl

* For those that want to compile from source, refer to the README.md file in the root directory.

* Please file bugs to https://github.com/voidstar-dev/SoftQuake/issues
  Although I've done my best to ensure that launching the game is as effortless as possible,
  there's no way that I could have covered all OS configurations.
  If you encounter an issue with launching the game, please let me know!
