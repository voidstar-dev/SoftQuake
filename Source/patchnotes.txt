========================
*** 1.0.0
*** 2023-09-01
========================
* Initial release
* Binary releases are available in the release section of the repository
  Players can use two versions of the game:
  
  softquake-sdl
  glquake-sdl

* For those that want to compile from source, refer to the README.md file in the root directory.

* Please file bugs to https://github.com/voidstar-dev/SoftQuake/issues
  Although I've done my best to ensure that launching the game is as effortless as possible,
  there's no way that I could have covered all OS configurations.
  If you encounter an issue with launching the game, please let me know!
