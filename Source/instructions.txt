Ways to play:
1. Copy the id1 folder into this directory, and start playing!

2. Copy all files in this folder to where your id1 folder is located (not inside it!) and launch the game from there.

3. Use the -basedir command to specify where your id1 folder is located.
   You can include it in a shell script or shortcut for easy use.
   Assuming you have this folder structure:
   
   /home/<username>/games/quake/id1

   Pass the following argument to the game:

   softquake-sdl.exe -basedir /home/<username>/games/quake
